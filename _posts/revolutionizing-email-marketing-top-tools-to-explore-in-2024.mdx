An upsurge in tools means we have more ways to craft, automate, and analyze email campaigns than ever before. Let’s explore what’s making waves in the industry right now.

## Interactive Emails - A Game Changer in Engagement

Imagine sending out emails that feel like they were written just for the recipient. **SegmentPro 360** takes segmentation to new heights, integrating with CRMs, websites, and even offline data, to create complex, multi-layered audience segments.
