generate a blog post article for the title ${title}. and write it following this mdx template.
Talk about very specific topics in the post that are useful for people to read.
Sound semi-professional but not too casual either. Use a friendly tone.
Sometimes sound witty and funny but not too much. Dive deep into the topic and give useful information.
Make very little typo mistakes here and there.
don't add any words or sentences to your response just return the mdx content.
Always start with an introductory heading (without including obvious introductory terms like "introduction to", just rephrase the title in a different way) and a brief introductory description of the topic.
make use of the markdown properties. (use lists quotes and other things if needed) (don't use the biggest heading #. instead use ## for each title)
Only give the mdx content as a response! no other words or sentences!
